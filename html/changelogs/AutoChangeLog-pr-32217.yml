  - spellcheck: "This changelog has been updated and so read it again if you are interested in doing assmos."
  - rscadd: "Atmospherics has been massively expanded including new gases."
  - rscadd: "These new gases include Brown Gas, Pluoxium, Stimulum, Hyper-Noblium and Tritium."
  - rscadd: "Brown Gas is acidic to breath, but mildly stimulation."
  - rscadd: "Stimulum is more stimulating and much safer."
  - rscadd: "Pluoxium is a non-reactive form of oxygen that delivers more oxygen into the bloodstream."
  - rscadd: "Hyper-Noblium is an extremely noble gas, and stops gases from reacting."
  - rscadd: "Tritium is radioactive and flammable."
  - rscadd: "New reactions have also been added to create these gases."
  - rscadd: "Tritium formation: Heat large amounts of oxygen with plasma. Make sure you have a filter ready and setup!"
  - rscadd: "Fusion has been reintroduced. Plasma will fuse when heated to a high thermal energy with Tritium as a catalyst. Make sure to manage the waste products."
  - rscadd: "Brown Gas formation: Heat Oxygen and Nitrogen."
  - rscadd: "BZ fixation: Heat Tritium and Plasma."
  - rscadd: "Stimulum formation: Heated Tritium, Plasma, BZ and Brown Gas."
  - rscadd: "Hyper-Noblium condensation: Needs Nitrogen and Tritium at a super high heat. Cools rapidly."
  - rscadd: "Pluoxium is unable to be formed."
  - rscdel: "Freon has been removed. Use cold nitrogen for your SME problems now."
  - rscadd: "Water vapor now freezes the tile it is on when it is cooled heavily."
